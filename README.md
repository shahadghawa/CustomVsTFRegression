The notebook from the repository compares a custom implementation of linear regression using gradient descent with a TensorFlow implementation. It covers the following:

1.	Data Loading and Preprocessing: Using the California housing dataset.
2.	Custom Linear Regression: Implements forward and backward passes, updating weights and biases.
3.	TensorFlow Regression: Utilizes Keras API for a similar model.
4.	Evaluation and Comparison: Compares Mean Squared Error (MSE) and visualizes predictions.
